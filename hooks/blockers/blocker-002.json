  "rootCause": "After spawning agents for Waves 1-3 (good parallel execution), I dropped into sequential manual MCP calls for Wave 4-5. I became the implementer instead of the orchestrator. Should have spawned Scene Polecat for Unity work, Eyes Polecat to verify, Evaluator to grade - all in parallel.",
  "observedBehavior": [
    "Waves 1-2: Correctly spawned 4 agents in parallel",
    "Wave 3: Spawned 1 agent (ok, single task)",
    "Wave 4-5: DID NOT spawn agents - did everything manually",
    "Made ~20 sequential MCP calls instead of delegating",
    "No parallelism, no verification agents, no evaluator"
  ],
  "expectedBehavior": [
    "Spawn Scene Polecat for scene creation",
    "Spawn Scene Polecat for prefab creation (parallel)",
    "Spawn Eyes Polecat to verify scene setup",
    "Spawn Evaluator to grade after each convoy",
    "Mayor only coordinates and tracks progress"

  "prevention": [
    "Mayor MUST delegate to polecats via Task tool",
    "Mayor MUST NOT make direct MCP calls except for status checks",
    "After spawning agents, wait for results before next wave",
    "Always spawn Evaluator after each convoy completion",
    "Track agent results, don't do their work"
